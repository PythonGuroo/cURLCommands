Options

Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an additional value next to them.

The short "single-dash" form of the options, -d for example, may be used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, -d, --data for example, requires a space between it and its value.

Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again disabled with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option name but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and show the --option version of them.

--abstract-unix-socket <path>

(HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead of using the network. Note: netstat shows the path of an abstract socket prefixed with '@', however the <path> argument should not have this leading character.

Example:

 curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

Added in 7.53.0.

--alt-svc <file name>

(HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file name again if it has been modified.

Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in memory.

If this option is used several times, curl will load contents from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

Example:

 curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

Added in 7.64.1.
